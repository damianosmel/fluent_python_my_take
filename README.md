# Fluent Python - My take
I have really enjoyed how simple and not in an authorative way the author, [Luciano Ramalho](https://ramalho.org/), explained how to use Python features for everyday programming.
Therefore, here I write down my take-home notes from studying the [Fluent Python (2nd edition)](https://https://www.fluentpython.com/), because as the Latin proverb says *"Scripta manet (, verba volant)."*.

More links about the book to explore:
 - Fluent Python's dedicated [github](https://github.com/fluentpython)
 - Feifeiyu's [notes](https://feifeiyum.github.io/2017/09/06/python-fp-obj/) on the same book


Hope it helps some of you exploring Python. :)
